### ASTM Project Grant Award

Thank you to ASTM International for th

Next was exploring the correlation between the tablets numerical readings, and the applied physical loads. The tablet was then strapped to the base of the Mark-10 instron, and the pen was clamped above it. The Mark-10 was programmed to apply compressive loads from 0.5N to 6N, in 0.5 intervals, and the numerical read-outs from the tablet were noted. 

Unfortunately, through collecting all this data, a rather distrubing discovery was made ...

The tablet struggles to differentiate between applied loads greater than 3.5N. So unless the biomechanical data miraculously falls into this range, we're going to need to make some changes. 

Of course, there's also the fact that this test needs to be redone with more data points, a moving average, etc. Additionally, a 3D printed component needs to be designed to hold the pen at different angles; in the above described experiment, the pen was held completely perpendicularly to the tablet, whereas scalpels are held nearly parallel to the area of interest during an operation. Thus collecting perpendicular data may not be the most accurate choice. This new test is scheduled for the end of December 2017. 


### Goldilocks Gauge

In any case, the next hurdle was to find a way to provide visual feedback to the user in regards to the force they're applying via the pen. We decided that mimicking a typical game health-bar would be the best understood by a wide audience, and affectionately titled it the "Goldilocks Gauge."
