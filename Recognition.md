### ASTM Project Grant Award

Thank you to ASTM International for this great honor! :)

The tablet struggles to differentiate between applied loads greater than 3.5N. So unless the biomechanical data miraculously falls into this range, we're going to need to make some changes. 

Of course, there's also the fact that this test needs to be redone with more data points, a moving average, etc. Additionally, a 3D printed component needs to be designed to hold the pen at different angles; in the above described experiment, the pen was held completely perpendicularly to the tablet, whereas scalpels are held nearly parallel to the area of interest during an operation. Thus collecting perpendicular data may not be the most accurate choice. This new test is scheduled for the end of December 2017. 


### Goldilocks Gauge

In any case, the next hurdle was to find a way to provide visual feedback to the user in regards to the force they're applying via the pen. We decided that mimicking a typical game health-bar would be the best understood by a wide audience, and affectionately titled it the "Goldilocks Gauge."
